    "The products impacted by an asteroid impact in Vietnam are **Product Alpha**, **Product Beta**, and **Product Gamma**.",
    "",
    "The reasoning is as follows:",
    "",
    "1. The query to find products that use a component named \"asteroid impact\" returned no results, indicating that there are no products directly associated with a component by that name.",
    "  ",
    "2. However, a separate query identified products supplied by suppliers located in Vietnam, which returned three products:",
    "   - Product Alpha (id: P1)",
    "   - Product Beta (id: P2)",
    "   - Product Gamma (id: P3)",
    "",
    "3. Although these products do not use a specific component named \"asteroid impact,\" they are nonetheless linked to suppliers in Vietnam. Thus, they can be considered impacted by the situation in Vietnam.",
    "",
    "4. A third query that attempted to identify factories producing products that use the \"asteroid impact\" component also returned no results, reinforcing that there are no direct products tied to the impacted component.",
    "",
    "In summary, while no products directly use the \"asteroid impact\" component, the products supplied by Vietnamese suppliers are the ones potentially impacted by any consequences stemming from an asteroid impact in Vietnam."
